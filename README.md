This is some simple program to make YT to feel more cozy, hope you enjoy


  To make this work, what you are going to want to do is install a YouTube improver or modifyer via the Firefox Addons or the Chrome Web Store, I use "YouTube Tweaks", then you are going paste the code into the corresponding areas "Custom CSS" and "Custom JavaScript". Afterwards, reload the YouTube website and the changes should be there!
